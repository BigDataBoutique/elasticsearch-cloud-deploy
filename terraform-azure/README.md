# Azure deployment

## Create the machine images with Packer

Go to the packer folder and see the README there. Once you have the machine image IDs, return here and continue with the next steps.

## Create key-pair or use your own

This deployment is configured to use your default SSH keys as machine credentials. If you want to use other keys, change the path to the keys you want to use (look for `key_path` in variables.tf). Use [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) to generate new keys if needed.

## Configurations

Edit `variables.tf` to specify the following:

* `azure_location` - the Azure location where to launch the cluster in.
* `azure_subscription_id`, `azure_client_id`, `azure_client_secret`, `azure_tenant_id` - the same credentials used in the Packer step. See the README there for instructions on how to retrieve them.
* `es_cluster` - the name of the Elasticsearch cluster to launch.
* `key_path` - the path to the SSH key to use as virtual machines login credentials.
* `data_instance_type`, `master_instance_type`, `client_instance_type` - Azure machine instance types to use for each machine type in the cluster.

The rest of the configurations are mostly around cluster topology and  machine types and sizes.

### Cluster topology

Two modes of deployment are supported:

* A recommended configuration, with dedicated master-eligible nodes, data nodes, and client nodes. This is a production-ready and best-practice configuration. See more details in the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html).
* Single node mode - mostly useful for experimentation

At this point we consider the role `ingest` as unanimous with `data`, so all data nodes are also ingest nodes.

The default mode is the single-node mode. To change it to the recommended configuration, edit `variables.tf` and set number of master nodes to 3, data nodes to at least 2, and client nodes to at least 1.

All nodes with the `client` role will be attached to an Azure load balancer, so access to all client nodes can be done via the DNS it exposes.

## Launch the cluster with Terraform

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

When terraform is done, you should see a lot of output ending with something like this:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

State path: terraform.tfstate

Outputs:

public_dns = elasticsearch-cluster-foo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
vm_password = rBTKoLsf7x8ODZVd
```

Note `clients_lb_public_ipaddress` and `vm-password` - that's your entry point to the cluster and the password for the `exampleuser` default user.

### Look around

The client nodes are the ones exposed to external networks. They provide Kibana, Kopf and direct Elasticsearch access. Client nodes are accessible via their public IPs (depending on your security group / VPC settings) and the DNS of the ELB they are attached to (see above).

Client nodes listen on port 8080 and are password protected. Access is managed by nginx which is expecting a username and password pair. Default ones are exampleuser/changeme. You can change those defaults by editing [this file](https://github.com/synhershko/elasticsearch-cloud-deploy/blob/master/packer/install-nginx.sh) and running Packer again.

On client nodes you will find:

* Kibana access is direct on port 80 of the load balancer host (http://host)
* [Cerebro](https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro) (a cluster management UI) is available on http://host/cerebro/
* For direct Elasticsearch access, go to http://host/es/
* In the single-node deployment mode, the default port is 8080 and the host is the machine host (not the load balancer)
* Grafana is accessible on port 3000 - http://host:3000/

The default credentials are `exampleuser` as username, and password as generated by Terraform during the deployment (`vm-password` in the outputs).

To ssh to one of the instances:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@{public IP / DNS of the instance or load balancer}
```
